# IBM-APPLIED-DATASCIENCE-CAPSTONE
Applied Data Science Capstone is the last module in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course on Coursera
In this capstone project, we will predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully using several machine learning classification algorithms.
The main steps in this project include:
1.Data collection, wrangling, and formatting
2.Exploratory data analysis
3.Interactive data visualization
4.Machine learning prediction
Our graphs show that some features of the rocket launches have a correlation with the outcome of the launches, i.e., success or failure.
It is also concluded that decision tree may be the best machine learning algorithm to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
